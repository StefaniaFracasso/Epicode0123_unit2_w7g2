<h2>Exercises on json and storage</h2>
<p>Create a simple registration form with an input field where the user can enter their name. Next to the input field, create two buttons: one will save the value in localStorage, one will remove the previously saved value (if any).
Show above the input field the previously saved value, if any.</p>
<p>Create a counter to keep track of the time that passes, using sessionStorage. Refreshing the page continues the value, closing the page begins again. The counter value must update every second. </p>
